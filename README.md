# ReliabilityRank

This is a naive Bayes classifer attempt to rank manufacturing equipment on a 5-point criticality scale based on similarity to various characteristics of other, already-ranked equipment.

Disclaimer - this data is taken from real equipment in a real manufacturing facility.  It is not complete and some aspects may have been altered for the purpose of this project.  Do not attempt to draw any conclusions from the actual data besides the ranking that the project intends.
